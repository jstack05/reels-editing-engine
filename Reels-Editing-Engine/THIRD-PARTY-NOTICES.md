# Third-Party Notices

The Reels Editing Engine is built and sold by Homewell LLC. It bundles or builds upon the open-source
components listed below, each used under its own license and credited here as those licenses require.
Nothing in this file limits your rights under those upstream licenses. Components that install on your
own machine at runtime (and are therefore not redistributed inside this package) are listed at the end
for completeness.

## Bundled components

### HyperFrames
- Source: https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes
- Copyright 2026 HeyGen, Inc.
- License: Apache License 2.0 (HyperFrames' own copy is included at `.claude/skills/hyperframes/LICENSE`,
  and the full text is available at https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
- The Effects Library (`product/effects-library.html`) lists the HyperFrames 0.8.181 catalog (names, titles and
  descriptions) and plays its demos through the HyperFrames player (`@hyperframes/player`, Apache License 2.0),
  loaded from a public CDN, with the previews HyperFrames publishes. `product/library-stills/` holds one frame
  captured from each of HyperFrames' own catalog demos that publishes no still; only demos with no outside images
  (photos, artwork, footage) are captured.
- The engine runs version 0.8.181 of the HyperFrames tool, and the skills under `.claude/skills/` are copies from
  its 0.8.158 release, with the skill files that changed through 0.8.181 brought up to that release
  (`hyperframes-cli`: TOOLKIT.md, references/beats.md, references/cloud.md, references/lint-validate-inspect.md and
  references/upgrade-info-misc.md; `hyperframes-animation`: TOOLKIT.md, blueprints-index.md, rules-index.md and the
  files under adapters/, blueprints/ (kinetic-type-beats.md, logo-assemble-lockup.md), references/motion-blur.md,
  rules/ and transitions/TRANSITION-REGISTRY.md; `hyperframes-core`: TOOLKIT.md; `hyperframes`: TOOLKIT.md and
  references/skill-lifecycle.md; `motion-graphics`: TOOLKIT.md; `media-use`: TOOLKIT.md, references/audio.md,
  references/operations.md, references/resolve.md, references/setup-providers.md, scripts/lib/manifest.mjs, scripts/lib/recipe-store.mjs and, under audio/, references/requirements.md,
  references/sfx.md, scripts/audio.mjs, scripts/lib/media-record.mjs, scripts/lib/sfx.mjs, scripts/lib/openverse.mjs
  and their tests; `faceless-explainer`, `pr-to-video` and `product-launch-video`: TOOLKIT.md and scripts/audio.mjs;
  `slideshow`: references/standalone-harness.md; `embedded-captions`: scripts/hf-cli.cjs, scripts/hf-cli.test.mjs,
  scripts/check-overflow.cjs, scripts/check-rail-climax.cjs, scripts/measure-layout.cjs and scripts/preview-frames.cjs). Twenty-three files are modified, and each carries a notice at its top saying what changed:
  - `.claude/skills/media-use/TOOLKIT.md`, `audio/references/sfx.md` and `audio/scripts/lib/sfx.mjs` keep sound
    effects on the bundled library and search Openverse only when asked (`HYPERFRAMES_SFX_OPENVERSE=1`), because a
    CC BY sound must be credited wherever a reel is posted.
  - `.claude/skills/hyperframes-cli/TOOLKIT.md` adds the rule that this engine never sends HyperFrames feedback
    reports, never runs `hyperframes usage` (it reads the Claude sign-in saved on the computer) and never hands a
    project to the HyperFrames desktop app; `references/preview-render.md` and `references/upgrade-info-misc.md`
    beside it carry the same rules.
  - `.claude/skills/hyperframes/TOOLKIT.md` never runs `hyperframes usage`, never presents the HyperFrames desktop
    app, and states in place what its routes to the `hyperframes-studio` skill said (that skill is not included).
  - `.claude/skills/general-video/TOOLKIT.md` never runs `hyperframes usage`.
  - `.claude/skills/hyperframes-registry/TOOLKIT.md`, `.claude/skills/motion-graphics/catalog-map.md` and
    `.claude/skills/motion-graphics/agents/builder.md` never send a catalog search-miss report.
  - In `.claude/skills/embedded-captions/`: `scripts/hf-cli.cjs` hands out the engine's pinned HyperFrames;
    `scripts/render-and-composite.sh` runs the engine's check before each pass and renders the passes one after
    the other; `scripts/prepare.sh` installs the caption helpers when missing and says ready only once
    safe-zones.json exists; `scripts/make-theme.cjs`, `scripts/make-cinematic.cjs`, `modes/cinematic/engine.html`
    and `modes/cinematic/cinematic-cream/template.html` give the footage a start time, size a project from its
    video and keep a portrait reel's top and bottom bands clear; `TOOLKIT.md` says `init` leaves the computer's
    global skills alone here. `scripts/source-size.cjs` is the engine's own addition, not a HyperFrames file.
  - `.claude/skills/hyperframes/references/intent-interview.md`,
    `.claude/skills/hyperframes-core/references/tracks-and-clips.md`,
    `.claude/skills/embedded-captions/references/aesthetic-principles.md` and
    `.claude/skills/embedded-captions/references/rail.md` state in place what their pointers to the
    `hyperframes-studio` skill said.
- Added beside the copies, not modified from them: `.claude/skills/hyperframes/LICENSE` (HyperFrames' own license)
  and the font license texts listed under "Fonts inside the HyperFrames skills" below.
- Used by the HyperFrames-family skills under `.claude/skills/` (hyperframes, hyperframes-core,
  hyperframes-animation, hyperframes-cli, hyperframes-creative, hyperframes-keyframes,
  hyperframes-registry, hyperframes-audio, media-use, faceless-explainer, general-video,
  product-launch-video, motion-graphics, slideshow, and related video-authoring skills).

### VectCutAPI and pyJianYingDraft
- Sources: VectCutAPI, https://github.com/sun-guannan/VectCutAPI (copyright its contributors), which
  includes pyJianYingDraft, https://github.com/GuanYixuan/pyJianYingDraft (copyright its contributors).
- Bundled at `product/engine/VectCutAPI/` (its own `LICENSE` file is retained there).
- License: Apache License 2.0.
- Modified by Homewell LLC. Each changed file carries a notice at the top saying so; files added by
  Homewell LLC (the setup and launcher scripts) are not part of the original.
- The bundled copy is modified: the original's unused cloud upload/download code was removed (`oss.py`
  and its Aliyun OSS `oss2` dependency, the remote draft-download path, and the default remote draft host,
  which now points at this computer), and a loopback-only request guard was added to the local server.
  A save that could not copy a clip into the draft now reports failure with the reason (the original logged it
  and reported success), and on Windows the server runs the engine's Microsoft Store app check when it starts.
- Used as the CapCut / JianYing draft-building engine. This package is not affiliated with or endorsed
  by the VectCutAPI or pyJianYingDraft authors, or by CapCut.

## Installed at runtime on your own machine (NOT redistributed in this package)

These tools are downloaded and installed onto your own computer the first time you run the engine. They
are not included in this package and remain under their own licenses:

- HyperFrames CLI (`npx hyperframes`) — Apache-2.0
- WhisperX and its models (faster-whisper, wav2vec2) — BSD / MIT
- Word aligners for languages WhisperX has none for, downloaded only the first time a reel in that language is
  cut: Bulgarian (`infinitejoy/wav2vec2-large-xls-r-300m-bulgarian`) — Apache-2.0; Icelandic
  (`language-and-voice-lab/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53-icelandic-ep30-967h`, Language and Voice Lab, Reykjavik
  University) — CC BY 4.0
- FFmpeg — LGPL / GPL, as installed on your machine: through Homebrew on a Mac, through winget on Windows, and
  as the static evermeet.cx build on an Intel Mac
- MusicGen (`facebook/musicgen-small`), downloaded only if you use generated background music: the model is
  licensed **CC BY-NC 4.0, non-commercial**. Tracks it makes are for trying a vibe; for anything you post or
  sell, use music you have the rights to.
- Python packages installed during setup ("set me up"; `check-setup.sh` only reports what is missing), for
  example Pillow — their own licenses
