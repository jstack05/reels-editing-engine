"""lookbook.py — the looks every style pack already has, drawn on any one line, by the engine's own builder.

Nothing here designs a look. The looks are the ones product/build-reel-type.py already makes in every pack
(hook, eyebrow + headline, headline + subhead, full-screen takeover, karaoke, single word, count-up card,
graphics breakaway); the pack is their skin. To draw a look on one line, this hands the builder a tiny job:
that line's words (timed from 0) and a caption plan asking for that look, then keeps the ONE layer it draws
(LAYER=hook / takeover / captions / breakaway / elements). So a look on the page, in the lookbook and in the
render is the same graphic, made the same way.

    python3 product/lookbook.py list
    python3 product/lookbook.py draw <look> <out_dir> --text "your words" --dur 3.2 [--pack Butter] [--job <job>]

The look's page (index.html + fonts) lands in <out_dir>/hf-reel-type-<pack>/, timed to the line, so the visual
editor plays it live. Her own saved looks live in _local/lookbooks/<pack>.json and survive every update: each is
one of these looks with her settings on top ({"id","name","base","plan": {...}}).

HER OWN DESIGNS (a new look, not one of the ten). A design is a composition template she workshopped with Claude,
saved per pack in _local/lookbooks/<pack>/designs/<id>/ (design.json + index.html + any assets she gave). It
wears the pack the same way the builder's looks do: every color, font, letter case and shadow comes from the pack
at draw time through the pk- variables below, never from the template. Her words go in its slots. The starter
(product/lookbook-designs/starter/) shows the contract; check_design() enforces it before anything is saved.

  slots        __TEXT__ (all the line's words) · __LINE1__ / __LINE2__ (small line, big words) ·
               __NUMBER__ / __LABEL__ (a count-up: the number in her words, and the rest) · __NUMBER_VALUE__ (JS) ·
               __EMOJI__ (an emoji pop: picked from the moment's words, emoji_for) ·
               __NOTE__ (words she wrote for the card that she doesn't say, e.g. an aside on a note card: kept in
               design.json "note", the same on every line it lands on. A note that WAS her spoken line, saved from
               the reel she made it on, is marked "note_follows_line": on every new reel it takes that reel's line,
               like any caption style, "first part / second part" split at the line's first pause mark)
               A design with the note AND a slot for her words (a checklist: a heading over her list) is given
               "heading / her words" for this reel's own heading (has_heading); without one it keeps the saved note
               __SAID__ (JS array: when she says each word, from the look's start; a design that follows her line
               has any hard-coded SAID array swapped for this reel's timings too)
  timing       __COMP__ (composition id) · __DUR__ (seconds on screen)
  fitted size  __PX_TEXT__ / __PX_LINE1__ / ... from design.json "fit": {slot: {role, box_w, max_px, max_lines}}
  pack skin    var(--pk-light|dark|muted|accent|pop2|hook|subhead) · var(--pk-shadow) ·
               font-family: PkHeadline | PkTakeover | PkCaption | PkAccent | PkLabel | PkDetail | PkThought (label,
               detail and thought wear the caption face when the pack has none; PkThought is the pack's thought-bubble
               hand, for an aside) · var(--pk-case-headline|takeover|caption|accent|label)
               for text-transform · var(--pk-track-headline|takeover|label) for letter-spacing
  pack shape   var(--pk-radius-card|label|frame) · var(--pk-pad-card) · var(--pk-shadow-card) · var(--pk-rule) ·
               var(--pk-ease) (CSS transitions; a GSAP tween uses window.pkEase) · var(--pk-extra-<name>) (her
               extra colors, only when the pack has them: give each a fallback). Always set, product/pack_shape.py.
