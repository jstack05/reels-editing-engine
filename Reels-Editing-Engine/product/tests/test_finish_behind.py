"""Guards: a look she marked "behind your head" exports from the page's Finish, never sends her to the chat.

  export    Finish no longer refuses a reel with a look behind her
  cutout    each behind look gets her cutout from her own footage over that look's stretch (graded like her footage),
            via HyperFrames' remove-background at the pinned version (through product/bg_remove.py), as a clear .mov;
            made once, reused after
  stacking  the behind look goes under everything, her cutout right over it, every other look and her captions on top
  render    the behind look renders without the over-her-face check (her cutout covers it on purpose)
  marked    a look SHE added (a GIF, a sandbox collage) and marked behind her is marked behind in looks.json, so
            Finish finds it (only the reel's own layers were)
  captions  a full-screen look behind her never makes her captions step aside (they play over her, it plays under)
