"""A short, quiet first line the listener's voice detector skipped is heard again and kept (ISS-99 part 2).

scripts/quiet_first_line.py, with stand-ins for the second listen (no model is loaded or downloaded):
  1. a lead-in with voice in it, and words found there: they go in front, in order, on the clip's own timeline
     (the stretch's start added back), marked heard_again, and the words after them stay exactly as they were
  2. a silent lead-in: never listened to again, the transcript unchanged
  3. the second listen finds nothing: the words unchanged (the clip only marked as checked)
  4. a word the second listen hands back over silence, or on top of her first heard word, is never kept
  5. a click is not voice; a first word under a second in is never looked at; a checked clip is never heard twice
  6. the file pass: exit 3 with nothing to do, exit 0 and the new transcript written when a line was kept
  7. word-timings.sh, handing back a heard job, runs the pass once in the speech tools' Python (a stand-in venv
     with a stand-in faster_whisper), keeps the old transcript in history/, and says so in one plain line
