"""Guard: a hiccup at the update server never reads as "you're up to date".

A buyer said "update me" while a new version was being published. The feed answered "not found" once, so the
updater fell back to an update file an earlier update had left in her folder, the same version she already had,
and reported "You're already up to date" while the server held a much newer one (buyer report, 2026-10-14).

Pinned here, against the real scripts/apply-update.py in a throwaway engine folder (no network: urlopen is a
stand-in):
  1. one failed answer is asked again, and the second answer is used;
  2. when both fail and the only file in her folder is NOT newer, nothing is applied and the message says the
     server didn't answer and that this doesn't mean she's up to date;
  3. when both fail and her folder holds a NEWER update file, that file is still used (offline updates work);
  4. the version of a file in her folder is read from its update.json, then its name.
