"""test_visual_editor.py — the style plan's visual editor can be trusted without anyone watching it.

Covered here:
  1. the page plays HER CUT IN ITS OWN ORDER: a line moved later in the cut plays where it sits, cut words show
     where she said them, every word appears exactly once; lines break at jumps
  2. apply: a word she cuts splits its piece at the right edges; a word she brings back becomes its own piece,
     no_trim (her call beats the double-take pass), butted against its neighbours' real edges, in the right
     place in the cut; choices are absolute (cutting a cut word or keeping a kept word changes nothing)
  3. refusals, each with a reason and nothing cut: the transcript changed, wrong reel, edits past the end,
     every word cut, a piece with no words under it, a piece from a clip that isn't in the transcript
  4. the paste fallback reads back exactly what the page wrote (ranges, spaces, "none"), and refuses junk
  5. the receipt: stable for the same edits, different for different ones; a hand-changed save is refused
  6. the server's save: only meaningful edits are kept, written atomically with a receipt; apply reads it once
     and sets it aside so a second "sent" can't apply it again
  7. the server itself: answers /ping, serves byte ranges, refuses a write from any other page (Host / Origin),
     refuses paths outside a reel's review/ folder
  8. two clips: the order and the pieces stay on the right clip
