"""Guards: a look she refined waits for Claude after a cut change only when ITS words moved.

  still    its first word sits where the look starts: nothing for Claude (looks-retimed stays empty)
  moved    its first word moved past the drift allowance: Claude redoes it
  cut      its first word was cut: Claude redoes it
  kept     a look she placed (a GIF she asked to start later, a look she trimmed) moves by exactly how far its own
           words moved, her start and length kept; moved twice, it never moves twice as far; a cut inside its
           words rebuilds it on its words, never on the word in its name
