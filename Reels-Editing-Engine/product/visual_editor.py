"""visual_editor.py — the style plan's VISUAL EDITOR: her script and her cut, live in her own browser.

She reads her reel as a script, cuts or brings back words, trims a clip's edges on the timeline, hears the cut instantly (the page skips over what is
cut; nothing is re-encoded while she works), then presses "Send my cut". The engine turns what she sent into the
cut and stitches ONCE, with the same clean-edge passes every rough cut gets. Text only (the in-chat style plan) is
still there for anyone who prefers it. Every control on her page, and how she reaches it: product/VISUAL-EDITOR-GUIDE.md.

    python3 product/visual_editor.py open <job>        get it ready (preview copy + script), start the page, open her browser
    python3 product/visual_editor.py prepare <job>     only the preview copy + script (safe to run beside transcription)
    python3 product/visual_editor.py apply <job>       she said "sent": her edits become the cut in a LEAN round (seconds: plan + clean

                                                     --full makes it again even when the video already matches the cut
    python3 product/visual_editor.py check-base <job>  exit 0 when outputs/<job>.mp4 matches the cut, 1 when a lean round left it behind

Rules it keeps, so it can be trusted without watching it:
  * The page plays HER CUT IN ITS OWN ORDER (cuts.json order), never filming order, so a moved line plays where
    it really sits. Lines the engine cut appear where she said them, struck through.
  * Her choices are absolute: "these words out", "these words in". A word she brought back is marked no_trim, so
    the double-take pass cannot quietly take it out again.
  * The edits name words by their place in the transcript. If the transcript itself changed since the page was
    made (words.json), the edits no longer point at the same words, and apply refuses rather than guessing.
  * One stitch per apply (stitch-cut.sh), the normal road: trim-restarts, snap-to-sound, frame grid, master.
  * Anything it cannot preview truthfully (a segment with no transcript words under it, a clip missing from the
    transcript) is refused with the reason, and the text-only style plan is the answer.
