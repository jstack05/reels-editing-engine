"""favorites_folder.py — the folder she drops her favorite sounds, GIFs and graphics into, read for the engine.

`favorites/` at the engine root has three drawers: `sounds/`, `gifs/` and `graphics/`. She drags files in from
Finder; the visual editor's Swap menus list them FIRST, ahead of the engine's own library. This is the plain-file
twin of the CapCut favorites project (`product/favorites.py`, which reads a CapCut project she points at): no
CapCut needed, nothing to learn. Both are hers, and both outrank the bundled library.

What scan() does with each file (the drawer she used is a hint, never a rule: a GIF dropped in sounds/ is still a
GIF, and is listed with her GIFs):
  * audio (.mp3 .wav .m4a .aac .aif/.aiff .flac .ogg .caf)  -> a sound. Up to 15 s is a sound effect (`use: sfx`),
    longer is a song for the music bed (`use: music`), the same line favorites.py draws (LONGEST_SFX_S).
  * .gif, and a .webp that moves                            -> a GIF
  * .png, .svg, a .webp that holds still, and a .mov/.webm with a see-through background -> a graphic
  * anything else is REFUSED with a plain reason she can act on (a .jpg can't be see-through, an .mp4 is footage,
    a file that won't open is named as one that won't open). Nothing is ever silently skipped.
Each file is checked: readable, opens in ffprobe, under the size and length limits below.

Rendered routes need motion graphics as transparent video, so a GIF (or a moving .webp, or a .webm graphic, whose
see-through background CapCut drops) gets a ProRes 4444 copy with alpha the first time it is needed:
render_copy(id). Copies live in `_local/favorites-cache/`, named by the file's size and timestamp, so a second ask
is instant and a file she replaces gets a fresh copy. Her originals are NEVER modified, moved or renamed.

Her files never leave her computer and never ship: `.gitignore` ignores everything in `favorites/` but the
READMEs, make-ship.sh copies only the READMEs into the buyer bundle (check-ship.sh section 35 holds it), and an
update never creates, overwrites or deletes anything in it but the READMEs (scripts/apply-update.py PROTECTED,
make-update.py, product/keep_changes.py SKIP_DIRS).

    python3 product/favorites_folder.py scan            # what's in her folder, what each is for, what was refused
    python3 product/favorites_folder.py scan --json     # the same, for a script or the page
    python3 product/favorites_folder.py prepare <id>    # the render-ready copy of one GIF / graphic (cached)
    python3 product/favorites_folder.py where           # the folder's path, to open it for her

Stdlib + ffmpeg/ffprobe (already required by the engine). Pillow is used only as a fallback for a moving .webp an
older ffmpeg cannot read; without either, that one file is refused with the reason.
