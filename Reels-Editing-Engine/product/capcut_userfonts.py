"""capcut_userfonts.py — resolve a font NAME to a real file on this machine, using CapCut's own font map.

Why: the animated engine (HyperFrames @font-face) needs the font FILE to render type outside CapCut.
CapCut already downloads every font the user adds — cloud-library fonts to
`…/User Data/Cache/effect/<id>/<hash>/font.ttf`, imported ones to the container `Library/Fonts/` — and
records them ALL in `…/User Data/Config/userFontData` as `<Font Name>=<absolute path>` (names URL-encoded).
So the engine can animate ANY font the buyer has in CapCut (premium / proprietary / free) WITHOUT us
shipping the file: the buyer adds it in CapCut once, and we read userFontData to find it.

Resolution order for a font (most reliable first):
  1) a bundled OFL file we ship (redistributable, machine-independent) — caller passes it
  2) CapCut's userFontData map (the buyer added the font in CapCut)
  3) CapCut's Library/Fonts by basename guess
  4) CapCut's in-app catalog cache (a font added via CapCut's text-panel search downloads to
     …/User Data/Cache/effect/<resource id>/<hash>/font.ttf, keyed by an opaque numeric id, not the
     name — so we open each cached file and read its REAL family name to match)
Returns None if the font isn't obtainable, so the caller can fall back to a pack default.
