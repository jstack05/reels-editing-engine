"""finish.py — the Finish step, run from the visual editor: her locked looks rendered and handed over.

Two ways out, the same as the chat's:
  * capcut  every look rendered once (the engine's own checked renderer), then her CapCut draft built with
            product/capcut_handoff.py: her cut on the main track, each look on its own named track at its own
            time, each sound cue its own clip. A new version every time (1.1 → 1.2), never over one she opened.
  * mp4     the same renders burned into her full-quality cut (product/burn_layers.py), at the footage's own
            size: outputs/<job>.final.mp4, plus a small phone copy to check it like a viewer would.

What it renders is exactly what the page plays: review/looks.json (her swaps, adds, moves and removals included).
Each look goes through `reel_render.py render`, so `hyperframes check`, the off-frame text check and the
"never over her face" check all run, and renders are cached by content (an unchanged look is not rendered again).
Never two renders at once. Nothing here changes quality: same renderer, same settings, same checks as the chat.

Progress for the page lives in review/finish.json: {state, step, done, of, route, result, made_for, message}.
`made_for` is a fingerprint of her looks, so the page can say "your looks changed since this render".
