On Windows, `npx` (like `npm`/`yarn`) is a batch script (`npx.cmd`), not a real .exe. Windows'
CreateProcess (what Python's subprocess uses without shell=True) can only launch real executables

`subprocess.run(["npx", ...])` fails with `FileNotFoundError: [WinError 2]` on every Windows machine,
while working fine on macOS/Linux (where `npx` is a real executable or a shebang script the OS can
exec directly). Routing through `cmd /c` lets Windows' own shell resolve and run the batch file
