"""reel_gate.py — the pre-render GATE for a rendered reel composition.

RELIES ON HYPERFRAMES, DOES NOT REINVENT IT. The gate is `hyperframes check` — HyperFrames' own native
verifier: lint, runtime, layout/overflow, motion, and WCAG contrast, sampled across the timeline AND at
transition seams (so content that grows by animating — a takeover stacking word-by-word, a karaoke line
filling — is checked at its true peak, not one frame). HyperFrames already solved geometry/layout/motion
correctness; a parallel custom measurer was a reinvention and is retired.

Style packs are INJECTIONS on top of HyperFrames (fonts / colors / shadow / sizes — like custom CSS on a
site), never new build logic. So this one native check governs EVERY pack (built by the creator or a buyer)
identically; the only deviations from HyperFrames are buyer-facing terminology and the raw editable-CapCut
route (which follows the creator's CapCut gold standards, not HyperFrames, and is exempt here).

  python3 product/reel_gate.py <composition_dir_or_html> [--canvas 1080x1920] [--pack Butter] \
      [--fmt yap] [--route well-done] [--register teaching] [--strict]

Exit 0 = clean (safe to render). Exit non-zero = check found errors — do NOT render until they are fixed.
reel_layout.py still resolves the pack dressing (safe zones, type floors, palette) the build injects.
