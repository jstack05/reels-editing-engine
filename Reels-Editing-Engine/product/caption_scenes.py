"""caption_scenes.py: where centered captions sit, scene by scene: CAPTION_GAP px under her chin, locked.

Centered captions (single word, karaoke, phrase, spotlight) never follow her chin frame by frame (no bouncing). They
hold ONE spot, and that spot is measured again only when the scene really changes: she sits down, moves to the couch,
the camera is set up somewhere else. Each piece of her cut is read with the face model chin_lock uses (YuNet), on the
editor's light preview copy of her footage. Pieces that hold her in about the same place join into one scene; a jump
of more than SCENE_JUMP px in where her chin sits starts a new scene. Each scene's spot is under where her chin
USUALLY is in it (each piece's middle reading, averaged by how long the piece plays), never the lowest it got: one
lean down to her laptop used to drag a whole scene's captions to the bottom of the frame.

  uv run product/caption_scenes.py <job>          writes projects/<job>/review/caption-scenes.json and prints it

Output: {"cut_id", "gap", "scenes": [[cut_t0, cut_t1, top_px], ...]} in cut seconds and 1080x1920 px (top_px =
where the top of the caption letters goes). Cached by cut: run again after her cut changes. A piece with no face
read joins the scene around it. (2026-10-17: "significant scene changes should reassess a new locked location
for the scene change. not track my chin's motion" · "true for everyone using center aligned captions". 2026-10-21:
"100 PX below my chin on average", every reel, "stationary and intentional placement per scene".)
