"""capcut_handoff.py — the CapCut project that ships ALONGSIDE a well-done reel.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Well-done bakes everything into one finished MP4, so when a creator wanted to change
her zooms there was nothing left to hand over: a baked file has no separate layers. The first PC tester
hit exactly that, asked three times to move to CapCut, and it took most of a day to get her a project she
could work in. Route A's spec said "nothing editable afterward" and there was no supported way to switch.
So well-done now hands over BOTH: the finished video, and a CapCut project beside it.

WHAT'S IN THE PROJECT (and what is not):
  • footage    — the engine's clean cut at scale 1.0, one clip per kept line (split where the rough cut
                 joined them; --one-clip lays it as one). THIS is the point: hers to trim, move and zoom.
                 With --punch (separate_layers.sh passes it) the plan's punch-in windows become
                 their own pieces at the plan's scale, held on her face: plain clip zooms, still hers.
  • layers     — with --layer NAME=FILE (repeatable) each KIND of element gets its OWN track, stacked
                 in the order given, so captions / hook / screens move, retime and switch off
                 independently. Reach for this whenever she asks for elements separated; do NOT answer
                 that with "that route is baked."
  • graphics   — the rendered overlay, one transparent clip sitting over the footage on the timeline.
                 On this route the type is already rendered, so it moves and retimes as a whole; it does
                 not come apart into individual words. That is what well-done means. Someone who wants
                 every element separate wants the medium route, and should be told so rather than sold this.
  • sound      — each cue as its OWN audio clip, never one pre-mixed wav, so a single cue can be moved,
                 swapped or turned down without touching the rest; each at the level the finished video gives
                 it, the music bed (when there is one) on its own track, and her Sound edits from the visual
                 editor (review/sound.json, product/sound_plan.py) applied.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO: it does not export. The finished MP4 is already the deliverable and the engine's
job ends there. This project is for HER changes; if she makes one, she exports it herself from CapCut.
Nothing here drives a CapCut export.

  uv run product/capcut_handoff.py <JOB> [--overlay <file.mov>] [--base <cut.mp4>] [--name <draft name>]\n\nRUN IT WITH `uv run`, not python3. This talks to the editing engine over HTTP, so it needs the\n`requests` package, and the system Python does not necessarily have it — on this very machine it\ndoes not. The script header above declares the dependency so `uv run` fetches it once and every\nmachine behaves the same, which is the same reason head-framing.py survived a PC where hook-burst.py\ndied with a missing import.

Needs the VectCut editing engine running (product/engine/VectCutAPI/start-editor.command, SETUP.md §1b)
and CapCut QUIT — CapCut's next save silently overwrites anything written while it is open.
