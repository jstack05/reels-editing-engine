"""reel_render.py — the ONE way to render a composition: GATED + CACHED + incremental.

  render    <comp_dir | index.html> -o out.mov [--strict] [--force]
      1) hashes the composition's source files; if unchanged since the last CLEAN render and the output still
         exists, SKIPS both the check and the render (instant no-op, says so).
      2) otherwise runs HyperFrames' native `check --at-transitions --frame-check` and REFUSES to render on
         errors. The gate is ENFORCED here, not advisory. --strict also fails on warnings — use it for any
         composition where every word must read (a transcript animation, captions).
      3) renders (mov = transparent overlay) and records the hash so the next identical run is a no-op.
         A caption layer whose builder left a render plan (render-spans.json, product/render_spans.py) is
         rendered only where it is on screen, one time-shifted copy per stretch, stitched back into the same
         full-length file with <out>.spans.json beside it; anything off falls back to the full render.
         REEL_FULL_RENDER=1 always renders full length.

  composite --base <footage> [--layers a.mov b.mov ...] [--audio x.mp3] -o final.mp4
      the cheap ffmpeg stack: base + transparent layers in order (+ optional audio track). Change ONE layer →
      re-render only that layer (cached by `render`) and re-run this (~15s). Never re-render the whole reel.

WHY (measured on a 30s 1080x1920 composition): check ≈ 40s, render ≈ 60s, and neither `-q draft` nor
`--gpu` changes that (the cost is frame CAPTURE). The only real speedups are to not repeat work that hasn't
changed, and to never re-render a full reel to change one layer. This wrapper makes both the default, and
makes the gate impossible to skip on the way to a render.

    word meant to hang off the edge carries data-layout-allow-overflow, which HyperFrames already honours, and

    alpha plane in ONE native ffmpeg pass and take each frame's SOLID-ink bbox (alpha >= 128; a drop-shadow spill
    is not a key visual); assert it sits inside the safe zone. Full-bleed frames (ink >= 90% of the frame) are
    designed backgrounds, not overlays, and are skipped.
    Measurer notes (validated against a hand-measured card: x 70..1009, y 1295..1559): the ProRes 4444 alpha
    plane is 12-bit, so it is forced to 8-bit gray before thresholding; and ffmpeg's cropdetect judges a row/column

    binary mask (a sparse column of real ink still averages > 1; a transparent frame reports YMAX=0 and an
    inverted bbox, both ignored).
    Returns (status, breaches): status "ok" = measured; "fullbleed" = solid ink in frames, but only full-frame

    A full-bleed frame is real content. It used to count as no ink at all, so a layer made only of a
