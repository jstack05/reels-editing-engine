"""cleanyap.py — the canonical CLEAN YAP build ENGINE for Naptime Creator Studio.

The TRIMMED-BACK lane, separate from the Super Yap engine on purpose.
A Clean Yap is: the locked rough cut, full-screen, + ONE hook (the pack's hook font) + thought bubbles
(the pack's thought font) + matched/trimmed SFX. Everything stays individually editable in CapCut. NOTHING loaded.

Deliberately does NOT expose the Super Yap machinery (full-screen pack-takeover-font takeover, doodle-sticker
layers, b-roll cutaways/bursts, stat cards, punch-in zooms). If a reel needs those, it's a Super Yap →
use superyap.py. Keeping the lanes separate in CODE is the point (the creator's rule #6, fix the system).

DONENESS != FORMAT (locked). "Clean vs Super" is the LOADED-NESS axis. "raw / medium /
well-done" is a SEPARATE doneness axis that applies to Clean Yaps too — don't assume Clean Yap == raw.
This module is the RAW Clean Yap engine (editable CapCut text). A Clean Yap can also ship medium
(build-hf-captions.py -> named .mov type layers) or well-done (build-reel-type.py -> baked MP4).

Shares the same engine mechanics/gotchas as superyap.py (VectCutAPI on :9001, font patch, main-track
normalize, register). Kept as a standalone module so the Super Yap engine is never in a Clean Yap's
import path. CapCut MUST be quit before finalize().
