"""sound_plan.py — every sound on a reel as rows she can hear, switch off and swap, and the build honoring them.

The visual editor's Sound section reads this: each sound effect on the reel (when it plays in the cut, what it sits
on, on/off, a Swap menu with HER favorites first and the engine's library after) and the music bed (on/off, swap,
level). What she picks is saved to ONE file per reel, `projects/<job>/review/sound.json`, and the builds read it.

## Where a reel's sounds come from (one source of truth, plus her edits on top)

The sound pass still decides the cues; nothing here re-plans them. They live where the pipeline already writes them:
  * `caption-plan.json` "sfx" / "music": the engine's plan (spoken_cues.py and the creative plan write it). The
    well-done bake (build-reel-mp4.py) and the CapCut handoff (capcut_handoff.py, also the medium route's
    separate-layers handover) read it. Cue shape: {"file": name-or-path, "at": cut seconds, "trim", "gain_db"?}.
  * `sfx-plan.json` "cues" / "music": an older per-reel shape some hand-built reels use ({"file", "t", "volume",
    "beat"}). Read for the page when caption-plan.json has no sfx; only that reel's own driver plays it.

`review/sound.json` is an OVERRIDE LAYER over that plan, not a second plan. That is the cleaner fit: the builders
already read the caption plan, and a layer keyed by cue means a re-planned reel never plays a stale copy. Each cue
has a stable id (`<sound>@<cut seconds>`); her edit to a cue (on/off, a swap) is kept by that id. A cue that is no
longer in the plan (the plan changed since she edited) is reported as an orphan and left out, never guessed onto
another cue. The file holds the full rows the page shows, so the page reads one file; only a cue's `on` and a swap
(`swapped`, `choice`, `file`, `name`, `source`), and the music's `edits`, are hers. Times, what a cue sits on and the
plan's own levels always come fresh from the plan.

    {"version": 1, "from": "caption-plan.json",
     "cues": [{"id", "t" (cut seconds), "name", "file" (engine-relative path, or absolute outside the engine),
               "source": "favorite"|"library"|"hers", "on": true, "gain_db", "gain_how": "auto"|"set",
               "on_look": layer name or null, "beat", "trim", "choice", "swapped", "original": {"name", "file"}}],
     "music": {"on", "name", "file", "level_db", "level_how", "choice", "at", "swapped",
               "edits": {"on"?, "file"/"name"/"source"/"choice" (a swapped song)?, "level_db": dB or "auto"?}}}

## Moments: every look that moves gets a sound row, timed to its motion

moments(job) reads review/looks.json "layers" (the captions layer and switched-off looks are skipped) and, for each
look, its composition's own timeline script (<dir>/index.html: `window.__timelines[id] = tl` with GSAP calls such
as `tl.fromTo("#hk0",{autoAlpha:0,...},{autoAlpha:1,duration:0.5,...},0.20)`). The ENTRANCE is the earliest tween
that makes something visible (fromTo/from from autoAlpha/opacity 0, a to/set that raises it), else the earliest
tween that moves something in; its position + the look's `offset` is the moment's cut time `t`, its duration the
motion length `motion_s` (a count-up runs to the end of its counting; a type-on to its last letter). No tween
found: `t` = the look's offset and `"timing": "start"` (else "motion"). EVERY MOTION GETS ITS OWN SOUND: a look that
brings in several things at separate moments (four cards popping in one after another, a list's lines) is one
moment per thing (entrances(): PART_GAP_S apart or more; a closer burst is one), keyed "<layer>#2", "#3" ... after
the first, each with its own sound row ("Part of your <look>" on the Sound tab). Positions timed by a loop
(`[0,1,2,3].forEach(i => tl.fromTo(..., T0 + i*0.45))`, `for (let i...)`) and a numeric stagger over a class are
read pass by pass. A look that shows her words as she says them (hook, takeover, captions, type-on) and a count-up
stay one moment. Two looks bringing something in on the same frame (a sketch's in-front and behind halves) are one
motion to the viewer: one sound (the later folds into the first, "with"). `kind` (pop / slide / rise / blur / reveal /
card / count / type / other) comes from the look's type (a counter, a type-on, a card) and else from how the
entrance moves (a blur, a scale-up, a slide, a small rise, a wipe).

A moment's sound is stored ANCHORED to its look, never to a time: {"anchor": {"layer", "at": "entrance"}}, so a
look that moves (or a cut that changes its offset) takes its sound with it on the next read. A planned cue already
sitting on a look's entrance (within MATCH_S) IS that look's sound, so a default is never stacked on top of it.

## Defaults that follow the motion (defaults_for / apply_defaults)

Per moment, by its kind, from HER sources first, in this order: (a) her favorites folder (favorites/sounds), (b) her
CapCut favorites shelf (product/favorites.py -> _local/sounds), (c) Epidemic Sound files she already downloaded
(LOCAL only, never a network call: the Epidemic Sound app's folder ~/Documents/Epidemic Sound and any reel's
sfx/epidemic*/ or audio/epidemic*/ folder), (d) the engine's shipped library (product/creative-vault/sfx/cc0 first,
then the bundled Pixabay set; the index's switched-off sounds never). The first source with a sound that fits the
kind wins (matched on the sound's own name / the index's description and job tag); inside it, the least-used fit
that isn't the cue just before, so nothing repeats back to back. Each is trimmed to its motion (a hit: the motion,
at least MIN_HIT_S; a type-on or count-up: exactly the motion) and auto-leveled like every cue.
REGISTER: a confessional reel (or a somber one) gets NO default sounds; its moments show "no sound" until she adds
one. The register is the one recorded for the reel (product/choices.py), or the one passed in.

## sound.json, besides the plan-cue edits

    "added": [{"id": "look:<layer>" | "add-<n>", "anchor": {"layer", "at": "entrance"} | null, "t" (free cues),
               "word"?, "choice", "file", "name", "source", "on", "none", "nudge" (s, +-NUDGE_MAX), "how":
               "default"|"hers"}],
    "sfx_enabled": true            the reel-wide Sound effects switch (off: no sound effects in any build; music stays)
    "voice_enabled": true          her clip's own sound (off = a muted clip: no voice on the CapCut main track, none in
                                   the MP4 export, none in the page's preview; the sound effects and music still play)
A plan cue's edit may also carry "nudge" and "none".

## Levels (the engine's rule, never a number she has to pick)

A swapped sound is leveled exactly the way the engine levels every cue (product/audio_levels.py): its peak measured
and placed SFX_DUCK_DB under the cut's peak, so any sound she picks lands at the same loudness. A cue the plan set by
hand keeps its level until she swaps it; the swap makes it auto. The music bed's level is auto (its mean
BED_DUCK_DB under her voice) until she sets `level_db`; "auto" puts it back. The gains shown are measured with the
same functions the builds use, cached in `_local/sound-levels.json` by file size + time.

## Which builds honor it

  * well-done (build-reel-mp4.py): yes, cues and bed, through for_build().
  * the CapCut project beside a well-done reel, and the medium route's separate-layers handover
    (capcut_handoff.py): yes, cues and bed, through for_build(); every cue now gets the same level the bake gives it.
  * raw / Super Yap CapCut drivers: when the driver places sound with `cleanyap.add_sound_plan(did, job)` (the step
    CLEANYAP.md and SUPERYAP.md now name), which reads the plan through for_build(). A driver that still hand-places
    cues with add_sfx in a loop does not see her edits; the page's rows come from the plan, so write the cues into
    caption-plan.json "sfx" first.
  * reels that only have an sfx-plan.json (older hand-built drivers) and the Voiceover route (vo-build.py's own
    music/ambience): not yet. Their drivers read their own files; cues_for_build(job) gives them the edited list.
  * a draft already in CapCut is never rewritten: her edits reach CapCut on the next build, as a new version.
  * every route above that reads for_build() also gets, with no change of its own: the sounds on her looks (each
    resolved to its look's entrance in looks.json at build time, trimmed to the motion, auto-leveled), the sounds
    she added at a time, nudges, "No sound here", and the reel-wide Sound effects switch (off = no cues at all;
    the music bed follows its own switch). finish.py's export mix reads it the same way.
