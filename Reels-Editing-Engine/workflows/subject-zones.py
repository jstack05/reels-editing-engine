subject-zones.py: the box a talking-head subject occupies in a take, and the open bands of frame around her.

In reel-layout-rules terms this is the measured subject band that Layer 1 places against. Layer 2 is
product/safe_zones.py, the platform's own UI strip: one fixed band, identical on every reel. The subject is
different on every shoot and every framing, so it has to be read off the footage. A spot is usable only when
it clears both, which is why every band below comes back already cut down to the Layer 2 band.

What it came out of: hooks landed on a creator's forehead while the top quarter of her frame was empty wall,
after she had asked more than once for that to stop. Remembering was never the problem. Placements were typed
by hand (transform_y 0.60, 0.62, 0.74 on different jobs), each carried over from the reel before. CapCut's
transform_y is (960 - y_px) / 960, which puts 0.60 at y384: clear of a subject framed low, on the forehead of
one framed high. With nothing reading where her head actually was, nothing could tell those two cases apart.

HOW IT READS HER. Frames are sampled across the whole window and each edge keeps its worst value, because a
spot that is clear on a typical frame and covered on her most animated one is not clear.

  head top     where her hair really starts, read against the room (head_framing.crown_rows): she moves and
               the room does not. YuNet's face box begins at the brow, and placing against it parks type in her
               hair. The middle reading wins (where her hair usually is). If the hair can't be read (a hood, a hat, low contrast), the
               face-box top stands in and head_top_source says so.
               A phone that drifts is laid back in place first, so window blinds or a door frame behind her are
               not read as her hair. Stills from another shot inside the window (a punch-in, a cut to another
               take) show a different room: they are left out of the hair search and covered by their own face
               box plus the hair allowance below, and head_top_source says so.
               A handheld selfie's room swings past her and cannot be compared (head_framing.room_unsteady checks
               the room beside her head first): the head top is then the face box's top less a measured hair
               allowance (HANDHELD_HAIR of its height), and head_top_source says that too.
  chin bottom  where her jaw usually is (the middle reading).
  left/right   where the face box usually sits, each side pushed out by EAR_SHARE of the median box width for
               the ears and the hair beside her cheeks, which the box leaves out (measured on her own takes).

WHAT IT RETURNS
  subject      her box, in source px (subject_src_px) and in 1080x1920 authoring px (subject)
  zones        four open bands in authoring px, each CLEARANCE clear of her and inside the Layer 2 band:
                 above   safe_zones.TOP           -> head_top - CLEARANCE
                 below   chin_bottom + CLEARANCE  -> safe_zones.BOTTOM
                 left    safe_zones.LEFT          -> head_left - CLEARANCE
                 right   head_right + CLEARANCE   -> safe_zones.RIGHT
               above and below also carry center_y_norm, the CapCut transform_y of their centre, so a builder
               receives the number instead of choosing one. The side bands report x0/x1, and roomier_side
               names the wider of the two.
  reading      what the numbers were read from: the source size, the stretch of footage (and the cuts.json
               it was read through, if any), how many frames showed her, and the clearance and ear allowance.

A band too small for one legible line comes back `usable: false` with the reason written out. That is a fact
about her framing rather than an error, and it is reported as one.

Usage:
  uv run workflows/subject-zones.py projects/<job>/outputs/<job>.mp4
      her box and the zones around her, kept with the job in subject-zones.json
  uv run workflows/subject-zones.py <video> --range 4.3,6.1
      reads only one graphic's time on screen, the fair window when she moves around during a reel
  uv run workflows/subject-zones.py <raw> --cuts projects/<job>/transcript/cuts.json --range 12.0,15.5
      the range is in seconds of the cut; each moment is found in the raw through cuts.json
  --json prints the whole answer as JSON, --out FILE saves it there, and --annotate OUT.PNG draws her box and
  the open bands on one of the frames it read.
