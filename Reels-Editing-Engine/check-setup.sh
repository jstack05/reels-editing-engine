# This file only reports. Every missing tool gets the exact line that installs it on THIS machine (Homebrew on
# an Apple-chip Mac, each tool's own download on an Intel Mac or an older macOS, winget under Git Bash on
# Windows), and set-me-up hands that line over word for word, so each one is a fixed string. Nothing here is
# installed, upgraded, deleted or configured.
#
# The report is grouped by the phase of a reel that needs each thing: the rough cut (reading, cutting and
# transcribing her clips), then the build (captions, text, graphics, placement, sound), then the style packs'
# fonts, then (on Windows) finishing in CapCut. Each row names the job a tool does before its own name.
# Exit 0 means nothing a reel needs is missing; 1 means something is left, which is the normal answer on a
# new machine and set-me-up says so.
#
# The transcriber itself (WhisperX large-v3 and torch) is outside this check: the rough cut sets up its own venv
# the first time it runs, and the "On first use" block says so.
