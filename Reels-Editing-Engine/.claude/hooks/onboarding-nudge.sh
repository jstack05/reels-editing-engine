#   missing tools      ffmpeg, ffprobe, node or uv are not on this machine
#   saved preferences  Part C of brand-kit.md holds at least one taught preference
#   stopped update     an update was interrupted partway (window closed, app quit, power cut)
#   unfinished update  an update landed but scripts/post-update.py has not run for this version
#   setup not done     brand-kit.md still has blank fields, the same count CLAUDE.md's "Fresh install?"
#                      section uses: any `{{` or an older copy's `<<`, never the example `{{this}}` a

#
# Before any of that it also repairs the global /studio link, silently, once she has said yes to it.
#
# set-me-up may not have run yet, so nothing here needs more than bash and the stock commands a new Mac and
# Git Bash both carry (Windows runs the engine in Git Bash, never WSL2 or PowerShell). Paths are relative to
# the engine folder, where Claude Code starts the hook.

# SessionStart reads extra context from a JSON object on stdout. Every message below is written as JSON
# string content already (\n for a line break, \" for a quote), so it goes in as it is.

# --- Keep the global /studio command working from ANY folder, once she has said yes to it (opt-in). ---
# Links this engine's Studio skill into the user's global Claude skills dir. Silent, idempotent, and
# HARDENED against the dangling-link bug that used to break /studio everywhere:
#   1. If a VALID global /studio already resolves (its SKILL.md is reachable), leave it ALONE. Never
#      repoint a working link, so a session opened in another copy of the engine can never hijack it.
#   2. Only heal a MISSING or DANGLING link, and NEVER from a throwaway location: system temp
#      (/tmp, /var/folders, $TMPDIR), any mktemp "tmp.XXXX" dir, or the make-ship "dist/" staging tree
#      that later gets rm -rf'd. Pointing the global link at a temp/staging copy is exactly what dangled
#      and broke /studio in every other folder. In a throwaway session we do nothing (a missing link for
#      that one temp session is fine; the next session in the real engine heals it).
# Writes NOTHING to stdout (this hook's stdout must stay valid JSON) and can never fail the session.
# Never clobbers a real folder the user placed at ~/.claude/skills/studio.
#
# Windows (Git Bash) needs its own kind of link. There `ln -s` quietly makes a COPY (MSYS's default), and a
# copy never follows an engine update, so /studio went stale after the first update and stayed that way.
# On Windows the link is a directory junction instead: a real link that needs no admin rights and no
# Developer Mode. A stale copy an earlier version of this hook left behind is recognised by its SKILL.md and
# swapped for a junction; it is moved aside to ~/.claude/, never deleted, and put back if the junction
# cannot be made.
