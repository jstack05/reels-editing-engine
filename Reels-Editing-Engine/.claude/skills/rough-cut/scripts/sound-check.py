"""sound-check.py: listen back to the stitch, the way stitch-cut.sh built it, and say what to do about it.

stitch-cut.sh makes the sound in three moves, and this reads the finished file back in the same order.

1. The master. A static gain (VOICE_GAIN_DB, +10 by default) into the voice master and its limiter, with a
   -1 dBFS ceiling, or -6 dBFS with WARM_MASTER=0 (the same switch the stitch reads). Reported: how much of
   her speech the limiter is holding down. Over the bar, the line names the gain to stitch again with: as
   many dB under the one used as it takes to come back to the bar, and never so many that the reel would
   come out quieter than the quietest reel the bar was measured on.
2. The joints. At every cut the outgoing sound runs on for the stitch's crossfade (6 ms, or the segment's own
   "xfade" in cuts.json) and fades into the next. Each joint is heard once, for a click (a burst on the cut
   that the sound around it never makes), a dip (the sound falling away on the cut while both sides carry
   sound) and dead air (exact digital silence). One joint is fixed on the segment it leads into, in
   transcript/cuts.json: "xfade": 0.030 first, then "keep_edges": true. The same fault across the reel means
   the crossfade itself stopped working, which no setting fixes: /report-a-problem.
3. The length. The sound should run exactly as long as the saved cut plan adds up to, plus at most the one
   AAC frame (1024 samples) the encoder may add at the end.

Each bar was measured on real stitched cuts, with the stitch's faults rebuilt on purpose, so a warning fires
where a fault is and stays quiet where none is. It only reports: it never fails a build or writes a file.

usage: sound-check.py <job_dir>     (stitch-cut.sh runs it after every rendered stitch)
Reads outputs/<job>.mp4 and transcript/cuts.json. Exit 0 when it listened (whatever it heard) or the file
was too short to judge; exit 2 when there was nothing to listen to, which is NOT CHECKED, not clean.
Standard library only.
