"""transcript-cut.py — TRANSCRIPT-DRIVEN rough cut (the clean way). Instead of cutting on loudness dips
(which leaves retakes in and chops mid-phrase), this reads the WhisperX words as SENTENCES, drops every
duplicate take / false-start / filler-only fragment (keeps the LAST clean take), and keeps each surviving
sentence from its first word's onset to its last word's offset. Inter-sentence dead air collapses to a
clean J-cut; intra-sentence rhythm is preserved. No ellipsis/silence segments, no mid-word cuts.

usage: transcript-cut.py <job> [--clip <name>] [--print]
  <job> is a job name, projects/<job>, or a path to the job folder (relative or absolute)
