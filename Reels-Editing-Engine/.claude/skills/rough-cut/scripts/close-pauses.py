"""close-pauses.py: the stitch's dead-air pass. No kept piece of her cut holds a long silence, however the plan
was made (transcript-cut.py, a cut Claude wrote by hand, a resumed or older cut).
    close-pauses.py <raw clips folder> <words.json> <cut plan .json> <where the tightened plan goes>
stitch-cut.sh runs it right after snap-to-sound.py. It listens to each piece's own audio (the transcript's
stamps can't be trusted here: WhisperX stretches a word across a pause, and a pause can sit before a line's
first word where no gap between words ever shows it) and closes every held silence longer than MAX_QUIET:
    in the middle of a piece   the piece becomes two, KEEP_AFTER of quiet after her voice stops and KEEP_BEFORE
                               before it starts again, so the beat between them still breathes
    at a piece's start / end   the edge moves in to KEEP_BEFORE before her voice / KEEP_AFTER after it
Left exactly as planned:
  - a piece with "keep_edges" (her own edges from the visual editor, a clip with no talking kept whole) or
    "no_trim" (words she brought back): her call stands
  - a silence holding a transcribed word of ordinary length (a soft word the meter reads as quiet is still a word)
  - a silence beside a spoken amount ("$27,000 ... a month later"): its spoken words sit in that pause
  - a piece whose sound has no clear voice-against-quiet contrast (a loud room): nothing can be measured there
Every line it changes is reported; CLOSE_PAUSES=0 in the stitch skips it. Standard library plus ffmpeg only.
