"""snap-to-sound.py: the stitch's second pass, which moves each cut boundary onto her actual voice.

    snap-to-sound.py <raw clips folder> <words.json> <cut plan .json> <where the snapped plan goes>

stitch-cut.sh runs it between trim-restarts.py and the frame grid. In: the raw clips, the WhisperX word
timings and the cut plan. Out: the same plan with its boundaries moved, written to <out_cuts.json> on every
run that finishes (an unchanged copy when nothing moved, so the stitch reads it without a second check). The
report of what moved goes to stderr. It uses the Python standard library only.

The words in the plan are final by the time this runs, so it keeps every one and changes only where each
segment starts and stops:

    boundary    measured edge                                         where the cut goes
    in-point    the voice starting after the last held quiet          42 ms before that edge
    out-point   the voice stopping before the next held quiet         60 ms after that edge

The edges come from the raw audio's loudness, read in 6 ms steps, not from the transcript. On her footage
WhisperX puts a word's start stamp a median 39 ms after her voice begins and its end stamp a median 75 ms
before it stops, so a cut on the stamps would take the front off a word and the tail off another. Each margin
covers the soft sound around a word (a breath into it, the ring after it) and adds half a frame, so the
frame grid that follows never rounds a cut back into her voice. A boundary never moves past a neighbouring
word's stamp or beyond the quiet it found, and where no held quiet exists (running speech) it stays where
the plan put it. Whatever it moves lands on the sound of the word the plan already chose.

How it works: a word's edges depend only on the word, its neighbours' stamps and the clip, never on where the
plan cut it. So each clip becomes a VoiceMap that measures a word's onset, offset and hidden second take the
first time a boundary asks for one and keeps the answer. Each boundary is then placed against that
measurement, within the limits below. Three cases it treats differently:
  - "keep_edges": true on a segment pins both its boundaries
  - two segments from one clip that meet in the raw are one take split on purpose; that joint is not moved
  - a spoken amount ("$27,000", "40%"): one stamp over several spoken words ("twenty-seven ... thousand ...
    dollars"), because the aligner cannot time digits. Its quiet inside is never a second take, and its edges
    are the first sound after the word before it and the last sound before the word after it, never the quiet
    beside its stamp (which can sit a whole word inside it)
  - a word she said twice that WhisperX returned as one long word ("Listen... listen," heard as one), found
    by held quiet inside the word's span: at the start of a segment the in-point moves to the second take,
    at the end the out-point lands after the first, and in the middle of a segment it is reported with the
    time to split at
