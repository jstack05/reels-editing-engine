# _mac-arch.sh — one source of truth for "which kind of Mac is this, and what installs here?"
#
# WHY: Homebrew's official installer now ABORTS unless `uname -m` is arm64:
#
#     UNAME_MACHINE="$(/usr/bin/uname -m)"
#     # On macOS, support Apple Silicon only
#     if [[ "${UNAME_MACHINE}" != "arm64" ]]
#     then
#       abort "Homebrew on macOS is only supported on Apple Silicon processors!"
#
# The whole Mac setup path in this engine was Homebrew, so on a non-arm64 Mac every install line the
# engine handed over was a line that could not work. The abort happens one step BEFORE the password
# prompt, so nothing hangs and nothing errors — the buyer just waits for a password prompt that is
# never coming. That is the reported symptom: "it never asked for my password."
#
# `uname -m` says x86_64 on two VERY different machines, and they need opposite answers:
#
#   1. An Apple Silicon Mac whose Terminal has "Open using Rosetta" ticked. The hardware is fine.
#      The fix is one checkbox, after which the NORMAL, fully supported Homebrew path works. Telling
#      this person "you have an Intel Mac" is a misreport that sends her down a slower path forever.
#   2. A genuine Intel Mac. Homebrew is gone for good here and every tool needs its own route.
#
# `hw.optional.arm64` reports the real HARDWARE regardless of translation (it is absent on a true
# Intel Mac), which is what separates the two. This is the same discrimination word-timings.sh and
# check-setup.sh were already each doing by hand; it lives here now so the three cannot drift apart.
#
# Everything below is report-only. Nothing here installs, writes, or needs sudo.

# mac_sysctl <args> — sysctl, found even when /usr/sbin is not on PATH. A shell started with a short PATH
# (/usr/bin:/bin) has no `sysctl` at all, and every reading then came back empty: an Apple-chip Mac was told
# "an Intel Mac" in the problem report's setup lines, right under "Computer: Mac (arm64)", and its chip line
# was blank (a buyer on an M1, 2026-10-22). The one on PATH comes first, so a test's stand-in still answers.

# ── Can Homebrew serve THIS Mac? ─────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Chip is not the whole answer any more. Homebrew only builds ready-made packages (bottles) for the macOS
# versions it supports, and its installer's MACOS_OLDEST_SUPPORTED is 15.0. MEASURED 2026-09-30 from
# formulae.brew.sh: ffmpeg, node and uv ship arm64 bottles for sequoia (15), tahoe (26) and newer only.
# On an Apple-chip Mac below 15 the installer prints a "not supported" warning, then sits on Apple's
# Command Line Tools download ("Finding available software"), and every `brew install` after it would
# compile from source for hours or fail. First reported by a launch-day buyer on macOS 13 (Ventura),
# whose setup "stays there" at exactly that line.
#
# Those Macs take the SAME no-Homebrew route an Intel Mac takes (scripts/intel-mac-install.sh), with
# Apple-chip builds instead of Intel ones. Only the install route changes: the chip is still arm64, so
# WhisperX, restart trimming and music generation all still run.
#
# Raise this when Homebrew raises its floor, and re-measure the bottles when you do.
MAC_BREW_OLDEST="${MAC_BREW_OLDEST:-15}"

# ── The Command Line Tools fallback ──────────────────────────────────────────
#
# A supported macOS is not the whole answer either. Homebrew's installer needs Apple's Command Line
# Tools, and it fetches them from Apple's Software Update server. On 2026-10-02 a buyer on an Apple-chip
# Mac on macOS 15+ (route `brew`) got Apple's own popup at that step: "Can't install the software because
# it is not currently available from the Software Update server." Homebrew cannot continue without the
# tools (it clones itself with git, and git IS one of those tools), so the normal route was a dead end
# on that Mac. Seen as either that popup, or `xcode-select: error: invalid developer directory` in the
# Homebrew Terminal.
#
# The way out is the direct route, which needs none of Apple's developer tools at all: every tool comes
# as a ready-made build (VERIFIED 2026-10-02 on 15+: ffmpeg/ffprobe static, uv, uv-managed Python,
# Pillow wheel, Node .pkg; the transcriber resolves to 107 arm64 wheels with `--only-binary :all:`, and
# hyperframes' npm tree has no native builds and no git dependencies). She runs it with
#     MAC_DIRECT_ROUTE=1 bash scripts/intel-mac-install.sh all
# and the installer PINS this Mac to `direct` (MAC_ROUTE_PIN). Without the pin every later check would
# say `brew` again: check-setup.sh would print the Homebrew line she already watched fail, and "set me
# up" would hand it to her a second time.
#
# The pin lives with her tools (~/.local/share), not in the engine folder, so a fresh engine download on
# the same Mac keeps it. It only counts while Homebrew is NOT installed: if she (or a later macOS update)
# gets Homebrew working, the normal route takes over again by itself, and a developer's Mac that has
