"""post-update.py — the small repairs every update needs AFTER its files have landed.

Runs automatically at the end of scripts/apply-update.py. An install updating from an older version runs
an older updater that does not know this step, so the update skill also runs it once by hand:
  python3 scripts/post-update.py          (Windows: python scripts/post-update.py)
Safe to run at any time; each repair is a no-op when there is nothing to do.

1. Refresh the engine's own instructions in CLAUDE.md, keeping the creator's block (merge-claude-md.py).
2. Put the executable bit back on every shell script and hook. The zip an update travels in can lose file
   modes on the way through an older updater, and then "./check-setup.sh" answers "permission denied".
   (Windows does not use the bit; skipped there.)
3. Tidy CHANGELOG.md when the updater added a second heading for the version the shipped changelog already
   described: the shipped, fuller entry is kept.
4. Bring her own changes to the engine forward (product/keep_changes.py): every file of hers the update
   replaced is re-applied on top of the new version where it does not collide, a pack she edited in place
   is kept as her own, and all of it is written down in _local/my-changes.md.
5. Print what's new in this version (its CHANGELOG.md entry), for the rundown she gets right after updating.
6. Until she has met the visual editor, say it is there and the two phrases that open it ("open my visual editor",
   "show me the visual editor"): what's new covers only this version, so a jump past v2.3.0 never mentioned it.

It also puts back what is HERS inside files an update replaces, whichever updater applied it: every style
pack she built (the quick fonts-and-accent kind included, and one an earlier update deleted, found again
in _update-backups/), and the settings she made inside shipped files (her permission mode, the hook
defaults and headline font her brand kit set). See product/pack_persist.py and product/settings_persist.py.
Those run first; keep_changes runs after them, so it never re-merges a setting or a pack they already
put back.
